<H2>What is GQLPlus?</H2>

GQLPlus is a drop-in replacement for sqlplus, an Oracle SQL client,
for UNIX and UNIX-like platforms. The difference between GQLPlus and
sqlplus is command-line editing and history, plus table-name and
column-name completion.  
<br>
As you know if you have used sqlplus, it is notoriously difficult to correct typing 
errors and other mistakes in your SQL statements. 
sqlplus does give you ability to use external editor to edit a statement, but only 
the last statement you typed. GQLPlus solves this problem by providing the familiar
command-line editing and history as in tcsh or bash shells, and
table/column-name completion, while otherwise retaining compatibility
with sqlplus. Thus, no user training is needed - simply use GQLPlus
instead of sqlplus. In addition, configuration/installation is
trivial: GQLPlus is a single binary compiled executable (written in
C), so all you need to do is download it and put it anywhere in your
PATH. After that, you'll be ready to use it.
GQLPlus is also available in RPM and DEB formats.

<H2>How does GQLPlus differ from other sqlplus front-end programs?</H2>

There are a number of other sqlplus front-end programs which include
this functionality. They, however, require some user training, and may
not be as easy to install (requiring particular version of Perl,
and/or particular set of Perl modules, and/or configuration files). 
In contrast, the design goal of GQLPlus was to remain as close as
possible to sqlplus, with the addition of command-line editing and
table and column name completion.  The command-line editing will be
familiar to UNIX users since it works as in command-line
shells. Additionally, there are no installation issues since the
program is a single binary executable.
