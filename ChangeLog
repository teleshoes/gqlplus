Changes between 1.12 and 1.13
*****************************

 - Introduced ENV var called SQLPLUS_BIN. 
 This is to support Oracle instantclient installations on 64bit 
 that do not call the binary sqlplus but rather sqlplus64.
 - Added mkinstalldirs script to source basedir
 - Introduced ENV var called EMACS_MODE. If setted, gqlplus is assumed
 to be launched from Emacs. 
 Emacs maps Ctrl-G to send SIGINT (instead of Ctrl-C). 
 So, during Emacs editing session we don't want to pass to it 
 sqlplus because it disrupts its' operation and does not make sense
 since that is not the interrupt we want to catch.

Changes between 1.13 and 1.14
*****************************
	
12-18-2011	20:15:07	Jess Portnoy <kernel01@gmail.com>
- Removed dependency of bundled readline. Though it is still shipped with the source code, one would have to explicitly ask to build it. We do not link against a static archive of ncurses why should we in the case of readline?
- Minor maintenance of the autotools files

Changes between 1.14 and 1.15
*****************************
	
01-23-2012	20:15:07	Jess Portnoy <kernel01@gmail.com>
- Use mkstemp() instead tmpnam() - patch suggestion made by Stefan Kuttler.
- Code also honors TMPDIR,  TEMPDIR and TEMP ENV vars [in that order], otherwise, defaults to /tmp.]

Changes between 1.15 and 1.16
*****************************
08-08-2014	20:00:07	Jess Portnoy <kernel01@gmail.com>
- patch by Philip Marsh <marsh@philipmarsh.org> for MAC OSX.
  0) Status Fatal: tmpdir is far too small for OSX which uses 80+? for a
  mkstemp filename. I have arbitrarily increased it to 500.
 
  1) Status Fatal: Using mkstemp and fdopen to handle a file is
  inappropiate and unnecessary.
 
  2) Status Idiosyncratic: The use of a second pointer (tmpname) to
  replace tmpdir is unnecessary and a little confusing(at the time).
 
  3) Status Fatal: OSX requires double quotes around the connect string,
  similar to your define for GET_PROMPT
